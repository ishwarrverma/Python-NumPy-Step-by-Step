
NumPy -> The name NumPy is shorthand for Numerical Python. The NumPy library offers a collection 
         of high-level mathematical functions including support for multi-dimensional arrays, masked 
         arrays and matrices
         NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on 
         large numbers of data.


Why NumPy -> without numpy we need for loop and list for calculating mathematical operation but 
             it will be slower for heavy data. So we use numpy

without numpy ->
   
temperatures = [32.5, 31.8, 33.0, 35.2, 36.6]
total = 0
for temp in temperatures:
    total += temp
average = total / len(temperatures)
print(average)

with numpy ->

import numpy as np

temperatures = np.array([32.5, 31.8, 33.0, 35.2, 36.6])
average = np.mean(temperatures)
print(average)
