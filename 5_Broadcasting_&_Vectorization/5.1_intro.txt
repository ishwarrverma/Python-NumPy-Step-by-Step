 Broadcasting -> It allows us to perform arithmetic/ mathematical operations on arrays of different
                 shapes without reshaping them

-> It automatically work for different shapes or array

How NumPy handle arrays of different shapes ->

     Rules                                         eg.

                                              arr1     arr2
1.  Matching dimensions                     [1,2,3] + [4,5,6]
                                               = [5,7,9]

2.  Expanding single element                 [1,2,3] + 10
                                             = [11,12,13]

3.  Incompatible shapes                      [1,2,3] + [1,2]
                                                _        _
                                                3        2
                                         Error - shapes are not matched 

Uses of Broadcasting Vectorization ->

Uses in AI and Deep Learning for calculating billions of numbers in seconds.
